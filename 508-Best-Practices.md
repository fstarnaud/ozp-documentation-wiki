OZONE Platform, developed as a government project, must accommodate all 508 disability requirements as required by federal law. In order to accommodate, some general purpose guidelines will be defined, and must be tested for release as part of the program lifecycle.

# Section 508 Refresh

The US Access Board is in the process of updating the Section 508 requirements and, according to estimates, should be finalizing the new requirements at the end of 2015. Once the changes come into effect, the US Access Board will require compliance with the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 rather than trying to maintain their own unique set of standards. WCAG 2.0 Level AA will be the minimum to comply with Section 508 once the new standards come into effect.

# ARIA

W3C has also created a development language supplement called Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Suite. It helps to identify and describe elements and how they relate to each other. This is a framework for adding attributes to complex applications that would otherwise be inaccessible because the native development language doesn't have certain capabilities. This enables technologies that have been inaccessible in the past to communicate more effectively with screen readers and other assistive technology devices. However, you don't need to double up. For example, if you are using an <`h1`> tag, there is **no** need to use ARIA to define the object's role as "heading". ARIA is only a supplement to help if a development language can't support identifying or describing elements in the application.
