NOTE: Ideal functionality would probably change if the "Favorite" bookmarks feature is added.

It would be optimal if users had a way of sorting their Bookmarks. IOB functionality is that bookmarks are ordered manually via drag and drop with each new bookmark added to the end of the list so that the user's bookmark order is preserved. It would be an additional feature to have an actual sorting capability.

## Desktop-style Sorting
In this style of a person's desktop, the listings act largely as they do currently but with the ability to sort their listings at any time.

General Organization: Manually ordered by user via drag and drop.

Initial: They are ordered by most recently added.

Sorting: When the user wants the listings ordered automatically, they click "Sort" and select the order in which they want the listings added. These possibilities will probably initially include: Alphabetically (A to Z), Alphabetically (Z to A), Date Added (Newest to Oldest), and Date Added (Oldest to Newest). The bookmarks and folders will then be sorted according to the chosen algorithm.

Afterward, the user will be able to manually order the bookmarks via drag and drop. No automated ordering changes will occur until the user sorts the listings.

## Automatic Sorting

General Organization: Automatic (unless manual option is chosen.)

Initial: They are initially ordered by whatever method is the system default (Probably either Alphabetically A to Z or Most Recently Added). This would be chosen by project stakeholders.

Sorting: The bookmarks and folders would be re-ordered constantly to match the chosen scheme. The choices will probably initially include: Alphabetically (A to Z), Alphabetically (Z to A), Date Added (Newest to Oldest), and Date Added (Oldest to Newest). Drag and drop would only allow folder creation, it would not allow for the re-ordering of bookmarks in the list. If someone moved a bookmark, it would automatically put the bookmark back in the list in order.

In order to accommodate the existing functionality and users who prefer a manual order, I would recommend that an option be added, probably named "Manual Ordering". This would allow the user to just order their bookmarks via Drag and Drop. New bookmarks would be added at the end of the list where they could be reordered manually. This list would not be automatically sorted in any way unless the user changed the sort method in the dropdown menu. Once that occurred, the list would be reordered. It would be ideal if the manual order was saved and would be the same if the user switched back to it after the automatic reordering.
