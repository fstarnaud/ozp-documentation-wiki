## Desktop-style Sorting
In this style of a person's desktop, the listings act largely as they do currently but with the ability to sort their listings at any time.

Initial: They are ordered by most recently added.
General Organization: Manually ordered by user via drag and drop.
Sort:
When the user wants the listings ordered automatically, they click "Sort" and select the order in which they want the listings added. These possibilities will probably initially include: Alphabetically (A to Z), Alphabetically (Z to A), Date Added (Newest to Oldest), and Date Added (Oldest to Newest). The bookmarks and folders will then be sorted according to the chosen algorithm.
Afterward, the user will be able to manually order the bookmarks via drag and drop. No automated ordering changes will occur until the user sorts the listings.
