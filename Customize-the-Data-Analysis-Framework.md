There will, inevitably, be some difficulties transitioning to a completely new system. Some users or organizations that are interested in using the new OZONE Platform may be heavily invested in a particular Data Analysis Framework (DAF) and are unable to completely switch staff to the Webtop at this time. We also recognize that there are some very small or highly specialized user groups who may have highly specialized tools that will work better for them than Webtop.

In order to allow for an easier transition and to allow users who are primarily interested in Marketplace and HUD to more effectively utilize the OZONE Platform, we would like to make it possible for the Data Analysis Framework to be supplemented with other options. While these other systems may not provide all the benefits of the OZONE properties created for usage within the OZONE ecosystem, we believe that it will help our users transition or more efficiently utilize the system.

These items would be added into the Marketplace as a listing type of "Data Analysis Framework" and then they could be linked to users' profiles in the system.

These other options would then be provided as:
* an option for applications in users' bookmarks to launch into
* an option for the default opening location in a user's account preferences
