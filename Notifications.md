Notifications are system-provided messages that deploy to each relevant individual user. The intent is for Notifications to be available to be sent from the system, from any individual organization, or from an application.

## Receiving Notifications
For the system messages, every user should receive the notification.
For the organizations' messages, every user associated with the organization should receive the notification.
For the applications/listings, every user who has bookmarked the listing should receive the notification.

## Sending Notifications
*These were the policy decisions at the time of last review and may be subject to change*

Owners of listings will be able to send messages only from their listing. These messages will need to be approved by a Steward of the listing's associated organization and then by a Marketplace Steward.

Organization Stewards will be able to send messages from their organization or any listing associated with their organization.

Marketplace Stewards will be able to send messages from the system, an organization, or any listing. These messages will not need to be approved by any other Steward.

## Questions
* Will messages from organizations have to be approved by the Marketplace Steward?
    * Can Org. Stewards cancel their notifications without approval from the Marketplace Steward?
* Will messages created by Org Stewards or MP Stewards for/from listings need to be approved in the typical fashion? (By Org Stewards and then by MP Stewards)
* What level of information about all the current notifications should Org Stewards have?
    * Should the get to see all the other orgs' notifications but not interact?
    * Should they only get to see notifications from their own org(s) and the listings associated with their org?
    * Should they get to see OZONE Platform notifications?
* Can an owner cancel an approved notification?
