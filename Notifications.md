Notifications are system-provided messages that deploy to each relevant individual user. The intent is for Notifications to be available to be sent from the system, from any individual organization, or from an application.

## Receiving Notifications
For the system messages, every user should receive the notification.
For the organizations' messages, every user associated with the organization should receive the notification.
For the applications/listings, every user who has bookmarked the listing should receive the notification.

## Sending Notifications
*These were the policy decisions at the time of last review and may be subject to change*

Owners of listings will be able to send messages only from their listing. These messages will need to be approved by the Steward of the listing's associated organization and then by the Marketplace Steward.

Organization Stewards will be able to send messages from their organization or any listing associated with their organization. These messages will need to be approved by the Marketplace Steward.

Marketplace Stewards will be able to send messages from the system, an organization, or any listing. These messages will not need to be approved by any other Steward.
