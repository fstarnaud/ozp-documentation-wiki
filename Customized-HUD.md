Conceptually, HUD was intended to be the customizable, central area for managing a user's experience with the OZONE Platform. The home HUD page was intended to be a custom, homepage created specifically for the user or user group that is accessing the system. Each person and each user group entering the system has their own set of concerns and their own priority tasks that they would want to accomplish. An organization's Steward might want to check the status of the applications in their organization and see if any new submissions had come in. A user might want to access his most frequently or most recently used bookmarks. A developer would want to submit new listings or check the status and metrics for existing listings. The list of different priorities and tasks could go on and on with each new user. So, the HUD homepage would be customizable to ensure that it worked for each user.

As seen below, the content in the HUD would be populated in specialized widgets that could access metrics and other data from the user's account and the listings associated with that account, through Bookmarks, Stewardship or Ownership, and display relevant information.

These widgets could include:
* All users
    * Most recently bookmarked applications
    * Most recently used applications
    * Recommended applications

* Developers
    * Publication Status overview for all owned listings in Marketplace
    * Metrics data for all owned listing
    * Number of users who had bookmarked a listing
    * Notification requests' status overview

* Organization Stewards or Organizational Leadership
    * Publication Status overview for all organization's listings in Marketplace
    * Private Status Requests Overview for all organization's listings in Marketplace
    * Top 10 most launched listings associated within an organization
    * Top 10 most bookmarked listings by all users within an organization
    * Top 10 rated listings associated with an organization
    * Lowest rated listings associated with an organization

* OZONE Platform Leadership or Marketplace Steward
    * Publication Status overview for all listings
    * Private Status Requests Overview for all listings
    * Top 10 most launched listings
    * Top 10 most bookmarked listings by all users
    * Top 10 rated listings
    * Lowest rated listings
    * Most used and least used buttons in Webtop
    * Frequency of launch into Webtop vs into New Tab (by day, by user's org., by application, by app type..)
