# User Tags

Policy questions need to be answered before further UX work can be done on this feature.

* Would the User's tags be visible to others in the system?
* If they are visible, are User's tags moderated?
* If they are moderated, are they approved prior to usage, approved prior to being associated with a listing, or flagged for moderation afterwards by other users?
* Is there a maximum number of tags per listing?
