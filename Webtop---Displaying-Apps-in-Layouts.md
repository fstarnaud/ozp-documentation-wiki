## Overview

In past versions of OWF, there have been a variety of methods used to display a group of applications within a single workspace. In the OZONE Platform, there are two primary layouts for applications, desktop and grid. We have created a method for incorporating additional ways to layout applications within the existing framework.

#### Tab Group - compressed view
There are more applications and the group is running out of space. The name area for those applications not currently on top compresses to display only the app icon.
