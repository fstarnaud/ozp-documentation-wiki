## OZONE Platform - Vision & Direction

### Overview
I'm sure for many of you, the big questions are "What are we doing here?" and "What are we making?"  As with any program or project, we need to understand what it is we're building so we can provide the best product possible.  Being that we are one of the largest open source communities in the U.S. Government, we cannot operate in a vacuum.  This should provide you with a general idea & basic goals so that we can continue moving forward.

OZONE is the continuous effort to integrate the entire community on a single computing platform.  Ozone Widget Framework, or OWF, was the first iteration of this effort.  OWF utilized a common webtop for download and usage across multiple organizations, and a search & discovery component - Ozone Marketplace (OMP) - that allowed users to find and use new applications.  With OZONE Platform (OZP), we're taking this to the next level by building a centralized software-as-a-service (SaaS) for use across multiple agencies and organizations that will allow users to access web-based applications.  These apps will use this SaaS to rapidly scale to accommodate heavy demand with minimal loss of performance.

The basic principles we're applying to the OZP SaaS are:
* Scale to accommodate 250,000+ users.
* Incorporate user input & user focus from Day One.
* Be relatively easy to deploy.
* Minimal to no loss of performance with increasing volume of users and traffic.
* Operate entirely within the browser; no outside components/programs to download and install.
* List applications for rapid search & discovery.
* Use open-source tools and methods for development & community outreach.


### Direction & Goals:
With the ideas above, let us incorporate these concepts to formulate our efforts.  During the course of the summer, the goals of the development effort are:
* Purpose/Scope: understand the intent and purpose behind the effort (I'm happy to put that into more detailed context, either via a PowerPoint, in-person discussion, or on a wiki)
* Analysis: assess all components that have been built & mocked up as of now - this effort is already largely underway, and is meant to make sure we can use as much as possible.
* Design: finalize a design document of the system that is signed off by the government - this will include high-level & detailed designs of what OZP will look like & do.
* Documentation: document EVERYTHING - this is something I will always stress on this program.  Since we are operating almost exclusively in the open and expectations are high, the transparency microscope is literally being thrust upon us.  Let us view this as a blessing, vice a curse, and ensure our documentation is thorough and detailed.  At a minimum, the following must be properly documented:
--* Source Code
--* Workflows
--* Design (see above)
--* REST APIs - while there will be some changes throughout, these docs should be pretty much complete before we start committing code to the back end.  It has been recommended that we use APIary as the repository for these docs, and I concur.  This process will allow coding to move forward with little interruption, and also allow testing procedures to be drafted.
* Testing: stand up, or at least have mostly stood up, all test environments on both high & low.
* Outreach: re-energize our community outreach and focus on getting users involved again.  Their input is essential to OZP's future.
* Prototype: produce a working prototype to demonstrate our intentions & capabilities to the community (o/a 30 September).
