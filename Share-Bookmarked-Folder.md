One solution to the requested **shared workflows feature** is implementation in HUD via bookmarked folders. This starts out as bare bones basic, but it allows for us to take it many different directions depending on what feedback we receive from users on how they use this. Currently this doesn't allow for receivers to access shared history (maybe that's a future HUD module if needed), or for senders to send updates to past shares (other than simply reshare it) -- because we want to make it clear that this is only a copy. No upkeep needed. This eliminates a lot of admin tools, privacy controls, settings, etc that would then complicate this and confuse/clash with future role of Center listings. This solution of sharing via bookmarked folder also significantly saves development time.

###Mockups
To share a HUD folder:

1. Sender creates a folder in HUD using bookmarked apps, and clicks "Share" from the folder modal.

2. Sender looks up their coworker and shares with them a copy of the folder.

3. Receiver gets a notification with the option to either add the folder to their own HUD or to ignore.

4. Once the folder has been added to their own HUD, receiver can launch the entire folder contents into a new dashboard.
