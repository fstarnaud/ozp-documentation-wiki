Sharing workflows is a feature that keeps coming up. One option is to do it through the HUD bookmarked folders, greatly decreasing development time and other complications. In this UX, the process would be as follows:

### 1. User clicks on a folder and clicks to share it.

###3. Receiver gets a notification of this share and the option to add the folder copy to their own HUD, or to ignore the share.
