## Vision & Direction of Ozone Platform (OZP)

### Overview
The Ozone open-source effort has been an attempt to integrate an entire community of users on a single computing platform.  Ozone Widget Framework, or OWF, was the first iteration of this effort, and it utilized a common webtop environment within the browser for download and usage across multiple organizations, and a search & discovery component - Ozone Marketplace (OMP) - that allowed users to find and use new applications.  Ozone Platform (OZP) is the continuation of the Ozone project, which unites the two into a centralized software-as-a-service (SaaS) framework for use across multiple organizations that will allow users to access web-based applications, as well as widgets.  Now a user can find the apps/widgets they need to use for their mission and use them in the same framework

### Goals of OZP
In creation and upcoming maintenance of OZP, the software will be successful as long as we can strive to meet these goals:
* Carry on the legacy of OWF via a browser-based common work environment
* Scale to accommodate 250,000+ users
* Incorporate user input & user focus
* Be relatively easy to deploy
* Rapidly scale to accommodate heavy demand with minimal to no loss of performance due to increasing volume of users and traffic
* Require no outside components/programs to download and install
* List applications for rapid search & discovery
* Use open-source tools and methods for development & community outreach
