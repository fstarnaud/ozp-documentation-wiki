* 'Bandwidth-restricted' AppsMall - can AppsMall operate w/out icons & images?
* Scheduled import
* Control intents & visualize on-going data-transmission within Webtop
* Customize the data analysis framework usage (Preferences, menus, and launching activity)
* Upload and export listings into HUD and/or Marketplace (as simple code files for easy manual sharing)
* Documentation "service" - templates, examples, etc to creating documentations for app submission
* Expand AppsMall between two monitors (multiscreen support)
* User feedback in OZP toolbar
* AppBuilder:
    * Tile layout builders
    * IWC support
    * IWC backwards compatibility
    * 508 assistance

* Featured Apps - two apps per organization ( Makes sense if there are 500+ of Apps)
* Featured Apps in individual categories ( Makes sense if there are 500+ of Apps)
