### Product Backlog
Product team Identifies
* MVI's: Smallest featue set that justifies a release
* Feature:  Discrete component of an MVI that is self-contained, but does not deliver a full capability to the end-user
* Acceptance Criteria: A set of steps to confirm a story is complete
* MVI, Features, and priority will be tracked in the ozp-documentation repo and integrated with Huboard

States:
* Backlog - feature written but not ready to be worked
* Ready - In queue to the worked by team
* In Progress - Someone is actively working
* QA - Testing, code review, documentation, or other validation work
* Done - Complete and ready to be deployed

Definition of Done: A feature/issue is complete when it is successfully unit tested, code developed, code committed to GitHub, documentation completed, and has passed its acceptance test criteria.
