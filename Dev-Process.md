### Product Backlog
Product team Identifies
* MVI's: Smallest featue set that justifies a release
* Feature:  Discrete component of an MVI that is self-contained, but does not deliver a full capability to the end-user
* Acceptance Criteria: A set of steps to confirm a story is complete
* MVI, Features, and priority will be tracked in the ozp-documentation repo and integrated with Huboard

States:
* Backlog - feature written but not ready to be worked
* Ready - In queue to the worked by team
* In Progress - Someone is actively working
* QA - Testing, code review, documentation, or other validation work
* Done - Complete and ready to be deployed

Definition of Done: A feature/issue is complete when it is successfully unit tested, code developed, code committed to GitHub, documentation completed, and has passed its acceptance test criteria.

### Dev Team Workflow


### Iterations
Two Week Iterations start and end on Wednesday
* Iteration 1 (25 June - 9 July)
* Iteration 2 (9 July - 23 July)

### Re-occurring Meetings
* Iteration Planning - Commit to and sign up for work. The Backlog needs to be prioritized and stories need to be broken down prior to meeting.
* Daily tagup - These can be virtual as some product teams are at different locations
    * What did you accomplish yesterday? 
    * What are your goals for today? 
    * Do you have any roadblocks or need assistance from another team member?
* Demonstrations - After ever iteration product teams should demonstrate completed features

### Communication
* Daily Leads Telecon - 8:15 - Someone from each product team should call into this meeting daily
* Use Slack to talk daily

### Coding Workflow
The basic workflow for each OZP team is done in a Kanban-like manner. Tasks are marked with the "Ready" tag when they are at the top of the priority list and can be worked. Developers should:

1. Grab a story that looks good
1. Ask questions about anything that doesn't make sense
1. Make a branch for the story and link to it on the story.
1. Coding, test, code, ask questions, code, and test.
1. Merge master into the branch.
1. Create a pull request for your branch. 
1. Everyone should take a look at the request and make comments
1. Approver reviews and signs off on the code.
1. Developer merges the code into master.
