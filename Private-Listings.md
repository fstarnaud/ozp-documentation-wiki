"Private" listings are listings which are only viewable by users within the listing's associated organization. They are not visible to users within other organizations.

Private listings will be visible to:
* Users within the associated organization
* Stewards of the associated organization
* Marketplace Stewards

To make a listing "Private", the system will utilize the same approval process as listing publication.
* The owner will submit a request to make the listing private with a short justification
* Organization Steward will approve or deny the request
* Marketplace Steward will approve or deny the request
